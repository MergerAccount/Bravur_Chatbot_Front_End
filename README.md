# Instructions for Bravur's AI Chatbot 

## Prerequisites:
- PyCharm Installed or Install Python

## Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaraBubanova/Bravurs_AI_Chatbot.git
cd Bravurs_AI_Chatbot
```

## Drag .env file into root directory (on Teams, deliverables folder)
This project requires a `.env` file containing necessary API keys and database connection details.

*   **Locate the `.env` file:** Please find this file in the shared location provided by the team (e.g., check the 'Deliverables' folder on Microsoft Teams or ask a team lead).
*   **Place the file:** Copy or move the `.env` file directly into the root `Bravurs_AI_Chatbot` directory (this is the folder you cloned in Step 1 and then used `cd` to enter).

python -m venv venv
